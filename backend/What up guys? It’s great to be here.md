What up guys? It’s great to be here
I just moved to LA recently
I’ve really been enjoying living in a city
With the 3rd largest police force
Not because im scared of crime or anything

And ben’s real drunk
So he’s like “w

So that I could have a head start 
I wasn’t really gonna run to be honest
I just wanted him an excuse to hit him in the balls
But right before he was about to run
The police asks Muzzi what his name is

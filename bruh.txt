What’s up guys
It’s great to be here 
I just moved Los Angeles recently
I’ve really been enjoying living in a city
With the 3rd largest police force
Not because I’m scared of crime or anything
But it's funny when your friends do stupid shit
And almost get arrested
But sometimes I feel kinda left out 
Cus when criminals see me
They just see an innocent nerd to leave alone
And when police see me
They also just see an innocent nerd 
So now i feel like i kinda have to commit a crime    
Just to prove to them that I’m not
Last week my alcoholic friend Ben told me he quit alcohol
He was like bro im so done drinking
But just so I can commit a crime in solidarity with you
I feel like we should drink tonight
We tell Dyllan we’re coming to his house
Dyllan's like. Do not come. It’s 2 am and you guys are wasted
But thank god that Ben is a complete asshole
Cus we decided to go anyway
But when we knock on the door
an Asian grandma shows up
looking like shes about to shit herself
Ben’s like “Hold up. You’re not Dyllan?”
I tried to explain we knocked on the wrong door
But i don't think i did a good job cus
Five minutes after leaving we hear police sirens
They tell us to sit on the curb
The chief cop is like "We're investigating an attempted robery of an
eldery lady by a Indian and Japanese teenager"
Ben's like "Holy shit... that was us"
"But I'm actually chinese"
Now the cop looks serious
He asks us if we've been drinking
And Ben shakes his head no
and then he looks at me as 
Like he doesn't know 
Which is kinda when you fart
And everyones looking around to figure out who did it
And just so you can avoid being accused
You ask the person next to you if it was them
The cops like are you sure you didnt go
to any grandmas houses today
The cop's like ok well she's in the back off the cop car
so we're gonna have step out to make sure it wasn't you
And when the grandma steps out of the car
I think I realized just how drunk and or stupid Ben really is
Cus I completely forgot I let Ben navigate and he must have
chosen the wrong adress cus when she steps out,
Ben's like "Grandma what are you doing here"






Not only because I knew he'd get maybe two feet max
But also just so I could punch him the balls

He points at me while saying my name to the cop


[before ben is like grandma, he tells the cop he didn’t go to any elderly lady’s house. The cop is like ok well we have her in the car to identify you. Ben is like 
Grandma?
